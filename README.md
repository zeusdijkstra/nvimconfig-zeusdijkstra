# Neovim config 

My own personal neovim configuration, built from scratch and inspired by **inspired by [@tjdevries](https://github.com/tjdevries)** and his awesome [*Advent of Neovim*](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLm323Lc7iSW_wuxqmKx_xxNtJC_hJbQ7R) series.
Teej making this whole series to talk about [telescope.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) btw.
