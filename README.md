# Neovim config 

My own personal neovim configuration, inspired by [@tjdevries](https://github.com/tjdevries) and his [*Advent of Neovim*](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLep05UYkc6wTyBe7kPjQFWVXTlhKeQejM&si=FJTXqbcbvIsLRC1Z) series.
teej making this whole series to talk about [telescope.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim), btw.
